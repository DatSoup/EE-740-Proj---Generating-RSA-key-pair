# Generating RSA keys (EE 740 project)
I completed this as a final project for my Electrical Engineering course 'Intrusion Detection Algorithms'. We were to pick a topic in cybersecurity which interested us and create a project around that concept. This program will generate a public and private RSA key pair using the 'Cryptography' library in python. It additionally has functions to encrypt and decrypt a hidden message text file using this generated key pair. I generated this program with the assistance of OpenAI's ChatGPT.

The presented hidden text file represents a ship's coordinates in the Indian ocean which needs to be shared securely. This program allows for the encryption and subsequent decryption of these coordinates using this program. Attached is my official research paper and PowerPoint presentation for this project.
